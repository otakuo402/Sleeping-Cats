This project is a game using Lua with LÃ–VE. It is based upon the Mario Side scroller from the Web track of CS50x.
This game has a start menu which includes a page detailing the lore of the game as well as the controls and goal.
The game has theoretically an infinite number of levels which are randomly generated, with the end goal of
completing 10 levels without waking any of the sleeping cats in the map.
